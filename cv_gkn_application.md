# Education:

## UWE: Robotics BEng (Hons): 2:1 (2022-2025)

Studied Robotics at UWE. 

### Final Year Project

- Designed control system for Assistive Robotic Arm attached to wheelchair.
- Implemented robotic control system for 6DoF robotic arm using eye-tracking, a
camera-switching mechanism, and a handheld controller. Implemented using
Python, ROS2 and OpenCV, with real time image processing and object detection.
- Evaluated the performance of multiple control schemes by designing and
conducting user testing experiments, then analysing task completion rates and
user satisfaction using standardised tests (NASA TLX and SUS).

### Group Design and Integration Project:

- worked in group to design and implement a robotic arm for pharmacutical
testing.
- Helped to write and then work to requirements, having regular meetings to
discuss most pressing requirements.
- Designed communication system between high level python code and
microcontroller-powered robotic arm.

## UWE: BA (Hons) Journalism (2019-2022)
studied journalism at UWE. Graduated 2022.
# Work experience:

## Research Internship - Bristol Centre for Machine Vision (2024):
- Acted as research assistant for study that used eye-tracking to detect early
signs of dementia. 
- Worked with researchers to manually label eye tracking data. 
- Made sure data labelling was submitted on-time by creating a 
data-labelling tool to track progress.
- Conducted statistical analysis on experimental data. 
- Completed literature review of other eye-tracking methods used to detect
early dementia symptoms.

## Marketing Assistant - Latcham (2023 - 2025)

- Moved Latcham from WordPress web environment to HubSpot, debugging and fixing
