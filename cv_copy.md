# Education:

## UWE: Robotics BEng (Hons): 
2:1 (2022-2025)

### Final Year Project:

- Designed control system for Assistive Robotic Arm attached to wheelchair.
- Used ROS2, QT and OpenCV to design a real-time gaze-processing pipleline that
detected when a user was looking at a screen, then used this to expand robot
control system.
- Evaluated the performance of multiple control schemes by designing and
conducting user testing experiments, then analysing task completion rates and
user satisfaction using standardised tests (NASA TLX and SUS).

### Group Design and Integration Project:

- Helped to write and then work to engineering requirements, having regular
meetings to discuss most pressing requirements.
- Focused on writing modular, extensable and testable code.
- Designed communication system between high level python code and
microcontroller-powered robotic arm.

## UWE: BA (Hons) Journalism:
(2019-2022)

# Work experience:

## Research Internship - Bristol Centre for Machine Vision (2024):
- Acted as research assistant for study that used eye-tracking to detect early
signs of dementia. 
- Worked with researchers to manually label eye tracking data. 
- Made sure data labelling was submitted on-time by creating a 
data-labelling tool to track progress.
- Conducted statistical analysis on experimental data. 
- Completed literature review of other eye-tracking methods used to detect
early dementia symptoms.

## Marketing Assistant - Latcham (2023 - 2025):

- Moved Latcham from WordPress web environment to HubSpot, debugging and fixing
